Oh, no, no, no. You found this project and you want to keep your Telegram
account online every minute. You're a monster.

I'm a monster too so tools are written in 3 Turing complete languages (POSIX
shell, Go, Python). Ok, ok, explanation: Python is because of an awesome
library "Telethon", Go is for a binary file of `random`, shell is for
while true do do do done. Look, nothing disgusting :-)

To start:

	python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

	go build random.go

	./hold.sh
